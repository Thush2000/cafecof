      <p class="ladefp">Latte is a unique coffee drink that is commonly made by using espresso,
        steamed milk, and milk foam.
      Moreover, a latte is the best way to enjoy coffee in the U.S. <br> Lattes really became popular in
      the 1980’s in Seattle – with great
        thanks to
        Starbucks one might think – and then they traveled across the USA over the next decade. A tall latte has
        12 ounces in a serving
        with 75 milligrams of caffeine.<br> It contains 180 calories of which 30 calories are from fat.
         There are 3 grams of total fat of which 2 grams are saturated fat.</p>
